## Group 3 Dashboard - Global Script

# This code script will be used to :
# To run the necessary libraries.
# Load in raw_data e.g. csv's & to assign to object name;
# Clean & wrangle raw_data and re-assign to object name;
# To write clean data e.g. csv's, to project clean_data folders;
# To develop global ggplot and palette parameters.
# To develop functions that can be used in the server.
