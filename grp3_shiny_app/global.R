## Group 3 Dashboard - Global Script

# This code script will be used to :
# To run the necessary libraries.
# Load in raw_data e.g. csv's & to assign to object name;
# Clean & wrangle raw_data and re-assign to object name;
# To write clean data e.g. csv's, to project clean_data folders;
# To develop global ggplot and palette parameters.
# To develop functions that can be used in the server.

### Load in data for diff tabs in shiny dashbaord

# Data for a&e waiting times - needed for summary tab

### Temporal Plots ### 
# This is data required for capacity insight.

# Create a plot to see how the number of delayed beds changes over time

### Geospatial Data ###
#This is data required for georgraphical insight.

# Non-Categorised Data
# This is data that does not fall into the above categories and may be
# common across datasets.



### Prediction Models ###
# This is data that predicts the trends of admission numbers and delayed discharge
# of beds for the next 3 years 



# Delayed Discharge Prediction Model

# to create a forecasting model using the fable package, we need to change our 
# dataframe into a tsibble where the key is a combination of the chosen columns 
# indexed by the datetime column.

  as_tsibble(key = c(hbt, age_group, reason_for_delay, number_of_delayed_bed_days), index = datetime)

# for some reason one of the forecasting models seems to be working better with 
# the format yearmonth, so we'll change our datetime column
# then we select the variables we need and sumamrise the number of delayed beds
delayed_dis_ts_sum <- delayed_dis_ts%>%
  mutate(datetime = yearmonth(datetime))%>%
  as_tsibble(index = datetime) %>%
  select(datetime, number_of_delayed_bed_days)%>%
  summarise(count = sum(number_of_delayed_bed_days))

# create a fit dataset which has the results from our three different models
fit_delayed <- delayed_dis_ts_sum %>%
  model(
    snaive = SNAIVE(count),
    mean_model = MEAN(count),
    arima = ARIMA(count)
  )

# with the models specified, we can now produce the forecasts.
# choose the number of future observations to forecast,
# this is called the forecast horizon
# once weâ€™ve calculated our forecast, we can visualise it using
# the autoplot() function that will produce a plot of all forecasts.
delayed_dischrge_prediction_model <- fit_delayed %>%
  fabletools::forecast(h = "3 years") %>%
  autoplot(delayed_dis_ts_sum)+
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "3-Year Forecast"))+
  labs(x = "", y = "number of delayed beds")
# by default, argument level = c(80,95) is passed to autoplot(), and so 80% and 95% prediction intervals
# are shown.
