### Names of group members

Scott Wright, Cameron Fraser, Alisa Tunonen & Mark Fojas

### Roles & responsibilities of each member

**Scott** worked on:

* Cleaning & wrangling of Bed Capacity Data;
* Bed Capacity analysis scripts and visualisation (plots).Analysis included 
inferential statistics - bootstrapping methods;
* Generated data joining script for group and joined datasets ready for analysis.

**Cameron** worked on:

* Cleaning & wrangling of Geospatial Data;
* Development of R-Shiny Web App (dashboard) inclusive of R-Shiny global, UI and server 
scripts;
* Led the process of merging each group members scripts into the above scripts
of R-Shiny Web App.

**Alisa** worked on:

* Identifying the datasets necessary to answer the questions set by the group as 
part of satisfying the brief; 
* Cleaning and wrangling of Admissions Data (including A&E Admissions);
* Admissions analysis scripts and visualisation (plots).Analysis included
use of predictive modelling. 

**Mark** worked on:

* Cleaning and wrangling of Delayed Discharge Data (inclusive of reviewing 
demographic influences such as age, reasons for delay and deprivation);
* Delayed discharge analysis scripts and visualisation (plots);
* Researched and considered influence of NHS staff numbers/working hours, for 
potential future analysis.

**Everyone** worked on:

* Reviewing the project brief and determining our approach to satisfying it -
posing questions for the collective group to consider, and exploring the areas 
highlighted;
* Dashboard design & layout (wireframe) - agreeing initial and final concepts both visually
and from a functional perspective (with the end user in mind);
* Development of group presentation (including  final delivery & rehearsal).


### Brief description of dashboard topic

The core topic for the dashboard  was the impact that winter might have on 
Scotland's health care system (NHS), primarily in the hospital (acute care) sector. 

Key focus areas and questions to be answered using the information 
provided by the dashboard, were:

1. To what extent is the ‘winter crises’ the media predicts real?;

2. How has winter impacted Scotland’s NHS in the past?;

3. Potential impact in winter 2022;

4. How might the pandemic influence the potential scenario?.

The dashboard outlines our topic in terms of providing insight into Temporal, 
Demographic & Geographic Aspects of the domain, and was designed such to provide 
the theoretical front end user (NHS Administration Staff) with user-friendly
access to information on key performance indicators (KPI's). 

The theoretical client for the project was Public Health Scotland (PHS)

### Stages of the project

The stages of this project were as follows:

**22nd April 2022;**

* Group review and consideration of project brief;
* Agreement on project management approach - communication & collaboration 
methods, action tracking & version control methods;
* Setting up of group repository on github.

**23rd to 24th April 2022;**

* Development & consolidation of group questions and allocation of focus 
areas to each team member, for further research and dataset identification. 
* Selection of datasets;
* Joining of datasets where applicable.

**25th to 26th April:**

* Initial dashboard planning and wireframe;
* Initital data analysis & visualisations.

**27th of April:**

* Continuation of dashboard development and analysis;
* Presentation preparation and rehearsal.

**28th of April:**

* Delivery of group project presentation inclusive of dashboard, to project 
client, Public Health Scotland.

### Which tools were used in the project

* Zoom (predominantly used at weekends when team members were remote working);
* Git/GitHub (collaboration & version control);
* Slack in aid of remote team communication and collaboration;
* R Studio (Integrated Development Environment);
* Morning (9.45am) and afternoon (2.30pm) team stand-ups (Mon-Fri).
* Meeting with Public Health Scotland representative on Monday 

### How did you gather and synthesise requirements for the project?

In the first instance, we needed to create clarity and a mutual understanding
within the group of what the project brief was, what outcomes we had to meet,
and how we would meet such outcomes.Each person within the group 
shared their own interpretation of the brief and their thoughts on how best to 
achieve the project outcomes. We began *"with the end user in mind"* and as a 
result, we reached consenus in an efficient and coordinated manner.

As the project evolved, our group prioritised the development of a dashboard which 
would ultimately, provide enough information, to allow the end user to answer the 
questions set/asked by the project brief.

Our dashboard focused on the following areas;

* Bed Capacity;
* Admissions;
* Delayed Discharge, and to
* Provide the functionality to observe the above through changing variables such 
as specialty, time, year, quarter, season, geographical location 
(health board/hospital), age and social deprivation.
